Teasing comic but true

Manuel VCS problems : 

- difficult to find the change you want
- difficult to understand what happened
- collaboration is hard. 

Collaboration : future you.

Raise hands if experience with git or other version controls systems ?

# Why version control 

A Version Control System (VCS) is a system that **keeps track of changes made to a collection of files or folder**. Such systems usually facilitate collaborations. 

Data is tracked as a list of **snapshots**, which also contains **metadata**.

Why is it usefull :
- Permits collaborative development
- Efficient for all projects sizes
- Automatically answer hard questions : who, when, why ? bisection ? 
- **Allows you to revert any changes and go back to a previous state**
- **Allows you to maintain several concurrent versions of the project**


**Remark**: Mailing is a valid but very manual VCS.

???

Exemple of parallell developpement problem with mails : 

- fixing an error while someone else review your code
- fix get lost
- fix again. 

Printing + red pen + Scan is primitive collaboration. 

---




# Version control and reproducible research

As academics, our work usually outputs a lot of plain text files:
- Main content as .tex files (definitions, theorems, proofs, etc..)
- References as .bib file
- Data as .csv file or other format 
- Source code that analyze data and produces graphs and tables
- Compilation pipeline as a <em>makefile</em>

Academics usually value **reproducibility** of results. This requires that you provide others a way to... reproduce your results. 

<b>A good VCS facilitates reproducibility</b> as it allows you and others to understand how the current result was made, and therefore faciliate drastically the reproduction of your results.

???

Consider again future-you as someone else. 

A **yes** to one of these questions means you probably need VCS: 

- Did you ever struggle to reproduce results (including yours) ? 
- Do you usually hold several versions of the same work ? 
- Do you ever modify a copy to keep the orginal safe *just in case* ? 
- Did you ever deleted work and wish you had not ? 

---

# Classical motivations

Good reasons to use version control:

- **Transparency** of work done
- **Better organization** of files and folder
- **Easy to track change**
- **Easy collaboration** (no need to mail things around).
- **Ensure reproducibility** of your work by anyone else
- **Huge potential for automation** *we will discuss that later* 

More precisely: 

- An academic project is **a set of changes made to a set of text files**.
- This is very close to a software project
- Tools from software engineers are applicable to academic work. 

**=> You should consider your work as a code base.**

Git interface = leaky abstraction, learning top-down is not very good. Avoid to follow the approach of the comic. 

Underlying design and ideas can be understood, instead of memorizing the interface. You'll understand what the commands do by understanding what they do to the data model. 


---

# Git's data model

A git **repository** is a collection of files and folders in a directory, here called **(root)**. A sample directory might look like that: 

```
(root) (tree)
  |
  |- analysis (tree)
  |  |
  |  | data.csv (blob)
  |  | script.jl (blob)
  |
  |- bibliograpy.bib (blob)
  |- paper.tex (blob)
  |- makefile (blob)
  |
```

Folders are called **trees**, files are called **blobs**. The data structure is **recursive** : trees can contain other trees and blobs.

Snapshots in git are called **commits**. They have metadata attached to them : 
- Author
- Description
- Date
- etc...

---

# Git's history model

Git models history as a Directed acyclic graph (DAG). Each snapshot, encapsulating the whole set of files and folders, is timestamped and metadata are added. One metadata is the **parent** snapshot. 

Exemple of a linear history: 

```
O <-- O <-- O
```

You can work on diferent things in paralel via branches:
```
O <-- O <-- O <-- O (you add a missing proof)
            ^
             \
              --- O <-- O (your coauthor fixes a notation)
```

Branches can then be merged:
```
O <-- O <-- O <-- O <---- O (both the proof and the notation fix are included)
            ^            /
             \          v
              --- O <-- O
```

???

o are commits (snapshots), and arrows are parenting. 

Merge conflicts : 
- handled automatically 
- Tools to facilitate handling them otherwise.

---

# Pseudo-implementation 

We can implement the git data model quite easily. 

A file is just of bunch of bytes : 
```julia
Blob = Vector{Byte}
```
A directory contains named files and directories
```julia
Tree = Dict{String,Union{Tree,Blob}}
```
A commit has parents, metadata, and the top-level tree
```julia
struct Commit
    parent::Vector{Commit} # might be empty 
    author::String
    message::String
    snapshot::Tree
end
```

This is a clean way to model history. 

---

# Objects and content-adressing 

An **object** is a blob, tree or commit. 

```julia
Object = Union{Blob,Tree,Commit}
```

Objects are **content-addressed**. What git maintains on disc is a store of objects with names : 

```julia
# The main git store: 
objects = Dict{String, Object}() # we initialize it empty. 
```

where the keys are the sha1-hashes of the objects:

```julia
function store!(objects,o)
    id = sha1(o)
    objects[id] = o
end

function load(objects,id)
    return objects[id]
end
```

???

Rq : hash functon turn a big piece of data into a small string. They give you a way to name a thing deterministically on the content of the thing. 

Rq : git implementation is mostly C, and some bash and perl scripts. 

Blobs, trees and commits are unified: they are all objects.

Looks like commits contains a lot of other comits, but everything is referenced by id (pointers) for efficiency: each object is stored on its own and refereces the others by their sha1-hash. 

---

## e156393cef8b62f30d58ca0eb37bf7a75221471e

A **Sha1 hash** is a hexadecimal string of 40 characters, such as `e156393...71e`.

- Sha1 is a **cryptographic hash function**: it is deterministic but chaotic
- Gives a "unique" identifier to a commit, which is in "bijection" with its content.

Sha1 names are really inconvenient. Thus git maintains a set of references: 

```julia
references = Dict{String,String}() # maps readable human names to sha1 hashes. 
```

Ex: `fix_bug_in_proof`, `master`, `HEAD`, `v0.1`, `sudmitted_version` ... 

We can now **refer to things by name** in the commit graph. 

**Remark**: The actual commit graph is immutable, but references are mutable. You can move the `fix_bug_in_proof` reference (while you cannot change hashes of already-done commits). 

---

# Example 1

All git commands make additions to the DAG and/or modifications to the references: 

```terminal 
git commit
git checkout
git branch
git merge
```

```
---------------------------------------------------
O <-- O <-- O (HEAD -> master)
--------------------------------------------------- git commit
O <-- O <-- O <-- O (HEAD -> master)
--------------------------------------------------- git branch; git checkout; git commit x2
O <-- O <-- O <-- O (master)
            ^            
             \          
              --- O <-- O (HEAD -> bugfix)
--------------------------------------------------- git checkout; git merge
O <-- O <-- O <-- O <---- O (HEAD -> master)
            ^            /
             \          v
              --- O <-- O (bugfix)
---------------------------------------------------
```

???

Draw a graph on the board: 

few commits and few references.

```

The current verison, tagged `v1.0`, will be the version we push to `arXiv` and send to review. But the paper requires that we send a version to review with specific notations, templating, etc... **Use a branch:**

```terminal 
lrnv@laptop paper $ git checkout -b templating
Switched to a new branch 'templating'
```

Now do stuff in that branch to comply with the requirements of the journal, and comit them.

# Ex. 2: The templating problem (2/3)

```

Now we send the version from the `templating` branch to the journal. While they revise is, we find some error in the paper. We need to fix the mistake in all the versions, right ?

```

Now both versions contain the error fix. You can of course do the same thing with more versions... 

**Remaind that** references are mutable, but objects are not. Remark that the templating commit has a different hash !

# Ex. 3: Github Actions

<a href="https://github.com/features/actions">Github Actions</a> are a great way to automatize some repetitive tasks around the publication of a paper: 

- Run the analysis and re-render the paper at each commit. 
- Provide a fixed URL for the output to distribute it. 
- Automatic testing and continuous integation of software. 
- Automatically compile stuff for you and your collaborators, or even reviewers.  
- Ensures constant reproducibility of your results through continuous integration

If you end up doing something repetitively, then probably you should automatize it:

- Less risk of error
- No more forgetting a step (e.g. forgetting to update a graph !) 

---

# Ex. 3.1: `git-latexdiff` magic

The <a href="https://gitlab.com/git-latexdiff/git-latexdiff">git-latexdiff</a> tool allows to compile a diffed version of the latex document. It can be done online directly at each commit to track changes on the go: 

<img src="img/diff.png" alt="XKCD Comic" style="width: 80%" />

---




# Ex. 4: Using issues to discuss and collaborate. 

If more than one author is involved, then a Github repository on which everyone writes modifications is usually a good thing. Github repo comes with a discussion area:  

- Issues can be used to **discuss potential modifications** together. They can be linked in commit messages for clearer retrospective and history. 
- Pull request to **validate together changes before merging them**.
- **Written and asynchronous discussion** is a powerful way to collaborate.


**Known example** : <a href="https://github.com/HoTT/book">Textbook on informal homotopy type theory</a>; 600pages book written in 6 months by more than 20 people, an exemple of *efficient collaboration*. See Andrej Bauer's <a href="https://math.andrej.com/2013/06/20/the-hott-book/">blog post</a>. More than 1000 issues and pull requests.

???

Asynchronous written collaboration is a lot better than oral meetings: 

- everyone can see what happened, and can re-read why. 
- nothing gets lots in your memory. 

---

## Ex. 5: Github Pages

Your project and/or your personal website and/or projects websites can be hosted and compiled directly from source, online, and served as website. 

<a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> allows you to pulish staticely generated websites such as blogs, documentations, applications of your packages, etc. A great way to communiate results that do not fit into the pdf standard. 

## Ex. 6: JOSS

<a href="https://joss.theoj.org/">JOSS</a> is a journal that **review and publishes code**, entirely based on GitHub. If you consider your code as part of your research outputs, then a JOSS review process is a great way to have this code reviewed by peers, publicly challenged, corrected... and published. A JOSS publication has a formal DOI attached to it, and can then be cited. 

---

## Ex. 7: Automatic releases

Github has the capacity to automatically produce and serve outputs on each modification to a repository. I use it to build my resume: 

- Add a ref in `papers.bib` or `confs.bib` or another one, comit & push. 
- Wait a little for it to compile `cv.pdf` and output at the fixed URL.

**The link to output is fixed** so that the person cliking on it will always get the last verison.

## Ex. 8: Cost-free experimentation

**Branching out** is a neat way of experimenting, e.g. a large refactoring of notations, without loosing what you already have.

**No risk of loosing your work => Costless inovation.**

*Branches are like soap: you should use them*. 

---

# Doggy-bag 

The key messages today are : 

- **You probably already use some kind of version control**.
- **Learning an efficient VCS such as git is probably worth your time**.
- **Asynchronous written collaboration** is a very powerful collaboration scheme for writing software, but also for research !
